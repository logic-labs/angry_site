# angry_site
This site is Angry! beacuse it was made only for show and demonstrate, that I can make something on Flask 
(even if this site is just a very little extended example from official Flask's "Tutorial") with PostgreSQL, 
SQLAlchemy and React, but I don't like to show and demonstrate, I like to solve real tasks. Make me 
happy - be sure, that I can solve any your task with Python, SQLAlchemy, Flask and React (or some other 
frontend library or framework, e. g. jQuery), and give me a real task! Thank you! :-) :-)
